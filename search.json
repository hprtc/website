    "text": "One of the key strengths of a club is its coaches.  Heathmont Parker Reserve Tennis Club prides itself on selecting great coaches who can instruct, encourage and improve our junior competition teams but also provide assistance on tennis technique for all of our members, regardless of age, gender, physical ability, fitness or experience.  We are delighted to have the services of Ben Longridge as our head coach.\n\n\n\nBen is a Tennis Victoria - Club Professional Coach\nBen has a young family of his own\nBen was previously a junior coach at Donvale Tennis Club\n\n\nPhilosophy\nBen and his coaching team have a primary focus of improving members tennis skill in a positive, fun manner. Group coaching is designed to give all students, in particularly children a solid grounding in all relevant areas of the game should they want to develop their tennis further with private lessons and extra match play (tournaments, representative competition etc.). We pride ourselves on everyone leaving each lesson with key areas and themes to work on, making the path to improvement easier to understand.\nDifferent coaching types require strategies but they still concentrate on these key areas:\n\nTechnical skill\nRules of the game\nGameplay\nTactics\nPhysical preparedness\nCo-ordination\n\nAs a player receiving coaching, there are some important things to remember that will make the coaching experience a more rewarding one:\n\nEmbrace the tasks you are given\nMake the coach aware of any injury you or your child may be carrying prior to the lesson start\nArrive at least 5 mins before the session to ensure you are ready to start and maximise your time on court\nThe coaching team encourages self-practice in your own time. Before your next lesson, take some time to work on themes that have been introduced in previous lessons.\nIf in doubt about weather, please call or text Ben for advice as to what is happening.\nThe coaching staff are knowledgeable. Feel free to ask questions!\nEquipment to bring: racquet, water bottle, towel, hat (summer months)\n\n\n\nCoaching options\n\nHot Shots\n\n4-7 year olds and introductory program.\nFor students beginning to play after school tennis.\nStudents are introduced to the concept of a warm up.\nFundamental motor skills are taught, as well as movement techniques used in tennis.\nSwing patterns are taught and practised on all commonly used tennis strokes.\n\n\n\nJunior Lessons\n\nSeparated into 3 groups, Development, Competitive and Performance.\nAll aspects of the game are covered in a fast paced and fun environment, from further evolution of stroke technique in development groups, right up to tactical analysis and fitness training in performance groups.\n\n\n\nSquad training\n\nFor more advanced juniors.\nThere is an emphasis on fitness, rallying and match tactics in these sessions.\nThere is an effort made to ensure there is a low coach-player ratio and squads run longer than junior lessons, with the aim of challenging the players.\n\n\n\nPrivate lessons\n\nFor maximum game improvement.\nLessons are individually tailored for each client according to their specific needs and abilities.\nFor those who really want to extend themselves, or just looking to improve a little bit faster.\nPrivate lessons are designed to work together with junior lessons and squads.\n\n\n\nAdult lessons\n\nAdult lessons can be booked on a small group, or individual basis.\nThese lessons are personalized to help achieve the goals of the client, ranging from stroke production, through to tactical knowledge and fitness based sessions."

    "text": "Greetings fellow tennis players!\nWe are enjoying the Spring weather at last and the grounds are looking beautiful. Thanks to all the members who keep it tidy and lovely both inside and outside. The junior season of Summer tennis has just kicked off after a busy Winter competition with an information session held on 7th October to announce teams, educate and inform the new parents and players of the routine required for Junior Competition and collect Ball money. If you were unable to attend, please remember to offer your ball money to James ASAP to reduce the burden on him having to chase it. 2 teams made the grand final and were runners up. Well done to all players, parents and our marvellous Junior Convenor, James Wotherspoon for his tireless efforts to keep everyone organised.\nWe are very excited to have finally have an updated team uniform due to the tremendous efforts of Erina Wotherspoon. You may have noticed the flyers all over the clubhouse! The polos are already being worn by a few lucky people who offered to buy sight unseen for the first test order. We have matching shorts and skorts available and are keen to place another bulk order by the end of this week (18th of October). You may send an order by email to jespoon@bigpond.com stating Name and size remembering there are Men’s and Ladies “cuts”. Your name can be added to the front pocket area (very useful for juniors who tend to lose things) but these named shirts must be paid for up front with the order. The payment can be made directly into the tennis club account with Your Name and “uniform” added to the description or paid directly to James or Erina this Saturday (19th). As many of you will want to check sizing there will be a try on sizing session on Saturday 26th of October after 2pm and another order will be placed following that.\nWe owe thanks to Bendigo Bank once again for generously providing the funding for new nets in this years’ round of community grants. They are much needed as I am sure you have all noticed that some shots go through our nets!\n\nOur local MP Jackson Taylor joined us for a brief hit last Saturday. He noted our parking woes and was very encouraging with our future goals, offering to assist in any way he is able. He is a dynamic 27-year-old with a bright future and enthusiasm for helping his community.\nBarry Plant real estate staff took to the courts for an evening of food, fun and tennis on the 1st of October. It is a pleasure to be able to offer our facility to such generous sponsors. I hope they enjoyed their visit and return in the future.\nCoach Ben Longridge is off to the US to represent Australia in his age group in a tournament from October through November again this year. Wishing you all the success you hope for Ben. We’ll be watching for any news.\nSo, remember to join whichever group you enjoy your tennis with or join us for a social hit on Saturday afternoons at 2pm. You and your friends are always welcome.\nFREE! MULCH Help yourselves to the mulch pile behind the club. We have way too much for our needs.\nHappy Hitting!\nSue Moreland"

    "text": "Winter 2022\nSome changes are afoot for us at HE Parker Reserve. We have made the decision to enter our Juniors in the Winter 22 season with WDTA.\nOur club is already affiliated with Waverley District Tennis Association and have had a number of weekend and weekday teams playing with them over the years. Geographically we are in an overlap space between the two associations with many teams in our local area also affiliated with WDTA.\nWe’ve given consideration to a range of factors and feel this will be a great option for our club at this time. Here’s a link to the association website: waverleytennis.asn.au.\nSome other advantages include:\n\nMore match play for our singles/doubles rubbers players. (Doubles is also a two set rubber so 4 sets instead of 3 each round. 33% more tennis!!)\nA more manageable team size for other formats. (eg Triples with capacity for more players but less pressure to fill a team if there are extenuating circumstances.)\nThe requirement for any all boys teams to play in all boys competition.\nMixed competition is actually mixed competition, so our girls get a better gender diverse experience. Some of our girls have barely seen another girl on the court all season!\nBranching out to meet new people and visit new places. Something made all too difficult in the 2020-21 Covid era.\n\nThe season begins on April 30/May 1. Match play commences at 8.15am on Saturdays and 8.30am on Sundays. Info will be sent out to teams as soon as it is available. Communication with WDTA has been great and it’s looking to be a great experience ahead.\nNote re Orange Ball: We will have one Orange Ball team sticking with ERT on Sundays as Waverley runs a very short season for that level and we’d like them to get a full season of play."

This will mean community social tennis can return but please remember we still need to socially distance with masks if not on court and please always check in with the QR codes whenever at the club. The club room is still closed at the moment.\nThere has been no change to the coaching directions, or competition at this point.\nStay safe, and happy hitting."

    "text": "Greetings folks.\nHoping this update finds you all well and ready to resume a new season of tennis. Great News; All competition tennis is able to resume from 22nd June. As this fall around school holidays, for most it will mean a commencement date during the week beginning 13th July. For the juniors, ERT are proposing a shortened winter season during term 3, followed by a normal summer comp.\nThe job of putting together the junior teams is always a big one so please let our Junior convenor, James Wotherspoon 0407357318, know CLEARLY ASAP if your child is or is not playing Saturday morning comp when it starts.\nFor adult competition, the same applies. Contact Chris or Don ASAP to ensure your team or availability to play in a team is clearly noted.\nOur clubhouse may be opened for use of the bathrooms. The covid 19 restrictions of groups of no more than 20 people indoors where the room allows 4 square metres per person. This means that our clubhouse can support 19 people indoors. Social distancing is recommended, with good hygiene practises. Remain aware of items you touch that may be touched by others. Please take your own water bottle or cup and provide food only for yourself. Use the hand sanitiser provided if you don’t have your own. Wipe down any communal facilities you use and importantly, if you are unwell, let your team or group know that you are playing it safe and stay away from others.\nIt has been great to be able to play tennis again these last few weeks. Wednesday evening from 7pm and Saturday afternoon from 2pm the courts are open for those who wish to have a social match. And coaching is in full swing.\nFriday ladies and Monday men’s social are up and running also.\nLooking forward to seeing you all on court . Thanks so much for your understanding and patience these last couple of months.\nHappy hitting! Sue Moreland"

    "text": "Welcome to the 2020 season of tennis!\nIt promises to be a busy time for all players with each associations’ season into the third week already. The heavy rain last week made us bless our courts as yet again we managed to get through matches where other clubs were forced to wash out. We even played social tennis on Saturday afternoon during the drizzle and the courts held up well. The dry weather over Christmas followed by the heavy rain has washed quite a lot of debris onto the property so we have planned a working Bee for Saturday the 14th March to tidy up the grounds. A list of jobs to be attempted is on the notice board in the club house. We are not limited to just these if you have any ideas of your own on what needs doing. Please join us any time after 11 am on Saturday and give us a hand. A pair of gardening gloves is advisable if you wish to work outside. A BBQ will be on the go for all participants.\nWe have received the new nets which were procured due to the generous grant sponsorship from the Ringwood East and Heathmont Bendigo Bank branches. The new manager of Heathmont branch, Dorothy Janky, visited recently to see the results of their grant. They are already on courts 4 and 5 with the others to follow soon. Many thanks Bendigo Bank.\nThe JUNIOR season finishes end of term 1 with the new teams for Winter season to be organised as soon as possible. This is an enormous task for our wonderful Junior convenor James Wotherspoon, and you can certainly help by clearly letting him know your child’s availability as soon as possible.\nUniforms can be ordered for those who need them, both senior and junior, by contacting Erina Wotherspoon on 0409868789. We have a limited amount of stock on hand and orders can take around 4 weeks to arrive so allow some time for delivery.\nThe Inter club round robin held on the 18th and 19 January was great fun. In the end Parker reserve put in two teams and we were joined by Heathmont and Miller Park. There was a terrific atmosphere with all players enjoying the format which saw a total of 12 sets being played by each participant over the two days. The Overall winner was Heathmont who played outstanding tennis. We made some new friends and look forward to repeating the event in the future.\nKeep your eyes open for the Club Championship dates which will likely be held in April. We would love to have as many members as possible take part this year. It will appear on the website, hprtc.org.au which has had a recent makeover.\nSue Moreland, Happy Hitting"

Another week and the building will be all ours again. I am looking forward to arranging our belongings into their new cupboards and storage and having our kitchen back to ourselves.\nI believe there will be a new keyless alarm system fitted. We will endeavour to teach all captains and organisers how to access the club room as soon as we have been taught ourselves.\nThe Club Championships are being held on the weekend of 22 – 24 June. A great opportunity to have some fun, test your skill and check out the new facilities. Entry forms will be available in the Clubhouse soon or from coach Ben Longridge. Please get your forms in asap to help us organise the event efficiently. The entry form can be accessed on line at: Club Championships Entry.\nOne of our new Club Championship prize sponsors, Simba, has a Sale coming up (Flyer attached). Well worth a trip down. Another great find for excellent products at great prices.\nMembership Renewal time is approaching fast and are due by June 30. Forms will be sent out electronically and will be available in the Clubhouse.

A warm start to the beginning of 2019 should test our fitness levels as competition tennis has resumed for most of us. There are new teams in all associations entered so please put your hand up as an emergency if you have not already done so (Chris 0401722040).\nAll teams are required in the adult sections to bring supper and milk, if playing at home, to share with your opposition team after the match.\nA reminder of General housekeeping post-match for all players, do dishes, vacuuming, and checking bathrooms are clean. Please place used balls into the cupboard between the office door and lost property basket in the box marked Competition Balls. Check external toilet is locked with swipe card, and Arm and lock the clubrooms when leaving is most appreciated.\nAlso, we seem to have had an enormous amount of property left behind last year so let’s aim to remember to take all our clothing, racquets, covers, drink bottles and shoes home with us this year. Should you have lost something please check the local opportunity shop in Heathmont where we have donated them.\nAn exciting new initiative which we would like to become an annual event is a round robin with dinner open to all people. Please consider taking part in this social event which will be professionally catered for and we hope will be great fun. It’s an opportunity to bring that friend who is always saying that they “must come down one day”. The event is taking place on the 16th of March, play starts at 12:30pm and the entry fee (all inclusive) is $50 per person. Please contact Ben Longridge should you have any questions or if you’d like to enter this event.\nPlease treat our courts and equipment with respect. There has been a spate of Court bag breakages recently. Please do not allow anyone to stand on the mat while being pulled. They are time consuming to fix and expensive to replace. If it continues the replacement bill will be sent to the offenders. Yes, the CCTV footage can see you.\nSue Moreland, Happy Hitting!"

    "text": "Greetings,\nMerry Christmas to you all. 2018 has almost passed us by and we have welcomed in a virtually new clubhouse and outdoor area and had many successes both on and off the court. 2019 promises to be the year where you can focus completely on enjoying your tennis instead of dodging builders and security fencing. Many thanks to you all for your endless patience during this process. Particularly our coach, Ben, who has not once complained to me about the increased difficulty this must have added to his day. His winning attitude in his whole approach to life is exemplary. I would also like to congratulate him on his personal tennis achievement winning the Victorian grass courts Singles championships over 35’s in Yarrawonga just recently. We are lucky to have him as our Head Coach.\nThere have been quite a few flags added to the collection this year in both the adult and junior competitions. But more importantly we are often complimented on the excellent sportsmanship displayed by teams, our friendly and welcoming members, making it a fun, positive place for all visitors and players to be. During the competition break we will open the courts on a Wednesday evening at 7.30pm for organised social play, and Saturday social will continue at 2pm.\nPlease make full use of the courts during the holidays. There will be holiday programs run for the children. If using the courts personally don’t forget that the new security system is proving tricky as we learn that the external toilet door must be relocked with the swipe card when you leave. The system does an automatic check at 11pm and if it has not been armed properly the security company attend and charge us an $88 call out fee. I am trying to get this adjusted but please be aware for now. Also remember general housekeeping goes a long way to making the clubhouse pleasant for each attendee.\nFREE. There is a large pile of mulch which anyone can help themselves to. We accidentally had too much delivered. So, give your garden some added protection from the summer heat and add some mulch.\nWe had several enjoyable events recently with our open Day on the first of December and Juniors and Friday ladies Christmas parties. The lucky winner of the Hamper this year was E. Sloan.\nI look forward to seeing you on court,\nSue Moreland,\nHappy Hitting!"

    "text": "General Information\nHPRTC junior completion is run through Eastern Region Tennis (ERT). We have a strong number of juniors with ages from 8 to 17 and a big mix of skills and experience. Eastern Region offer a wide variety of tennis competitions for Juniors in the Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne on Saturdays and Sundays, boys and girls combinations in either Doubles or Single/Doubles formats.\nTeams are selected at the discretion of the Junior Selection Committee. Each team requires a parent to be a team manager to be a contact person for the team. Should no parent be willing to take on this role for a particular team, that team will be withdrawn prior to the start of the season. Parents will also need to commit to a rotating roster for manning the canteen when playing at home. There are plenty of old hands to help you on your first couple of time and it is usually good fun.\nJuniors must be financial members of the club to play in this competition.\n\n\nContact Information\nJunior Convener: James Ni junior@hprtc.org.au\nPresident: Sue Cornish president@hprtc.org.au or 0425 711 364\n\n\nCommitment to play\nPlayers should understand that:\n\nThis is club tennis, rather than social or tournament tennis and the intention is to make new friends at the club and enjoy tennis.\nThe selection of teams is not practical if players make it conditional that they play with friends. Whilst we will make every endeavour to accommodate preferences, consideration has to be given to similar standard of ability.\nCommitting to play, means committing to a team, so any second thoughts once a team is created may lead to that team being withdrawn if players have a change of heart. As this is a team sport, this means innocent players miss out.\nIf they think a friend may be playing and if this is important, they should check that is the case and not assume.\nIf there is any information about playing ability that you would like the convenors to know and not guess, please make sure you write it down on the application form.\n\n\n\nTeams and team selection\nSelecting teams for competition can often be a contentious process but shouldn’t be. There are some guiding principles that the selection committee uses when selecting teams. These guidelines are applied in the following order:\n\nSkill, age and ability\nTeam availability\nFriendship groups\nPersonal requests\n\nIt is important to be aware that the association that governs this competition uses player statistics to determine its recommendation for the level that each player should be at. There is some flexibility in this but the aim is to have competitive tennis for your player and their competitors throughout the season. The ranking is based on singles games won and lost and the average playing position. This information is available to the Junior Selection Committee and is made available to the teams during team selection and halfway through the season for review.\nA grading day is typically held 4 to 5 weeks before the teams need to be submitted to ERT for review and confirmation. This is a fun day where the juniors pop down with their parents to the courts. For those who have played before we review the current ranking as provided by ERT and the reviews playing technique. Parents get a chance to meet with other parents to discuss rostering and car pooling if required.\nJunior players are considerably more robust that us parents give them credit for and while many players have a preference with whom they would like to play with, most children adapt very well to the team they join. It is important as parents and guardians that we encourage our children to have new experiences and meet new members of the club.\n\n\nJunior Selection Committee\nThe junior selection committee is generally made up of the Junior Convenor, Assistant Junior Convenor and the coaches.\nThe Junior Convenor role is split into two parts to reduce the load on any given parent. We have one parent who does the Saturday morning duties of opening the club and organising play on the day. The other parent (normally the assistant convenor) is doing much of the paperwork, particularly at team selection time.\nIf you are passionate about your child’s tennis or would simply like to help out, please enquire about the convenor roles or assisting on the selection committee by sending an email to president@hprtc.org.au."

    "text": "AGM – Saturday 29th July 2023\nYour tennis club has been built up over many years, from 4 en-tout-cas courts and a log cabin clubhouse to the 6 poly clay waterless courts (complete with lighting) and a re-modelled clubhouse. Many of the current committee members have been working over many years in developing the club. As such, some committee members are looking at handing over, at least some of their responsibilities to the “next generation” of players/members. Now is the time to get involved while the “current generation” is able to transition new people into management positions. It is clearly understood that future management may look completely different to the current committee structure, but this change will need to be developed by you, the next managers.\nPlease give earnest consideration to becoming involved in the club. Please let any of the current management committee, Ben or Kish, if you would like to be involved or would like more information."

Coaching and organised member play can resume, however competition will come at a later date, stay tuned for these details.\nIn order to re-open in a Covid safe way, there are some restrictions that will need to be followed. These restrictions are as per Tennis Victoria and the Government and are outlined below.\n\nSingles play for two people can return regardless of vaccination status.\nDoubles play for four people can return for double vaccinated players from no more than two households. Players must carry vaccination proof in case asked for it from an authorised officer.\nWhere a player has obtained certification from a medical practitioner that the person is unable due to medical contraindication to receive a dose or a further dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, they are classified as exempted and count as a fully vaccinated player.\nPlayers younger than 12 years are treated as fully vaccinated.\nPlayers must reside within 15km of the club.\nFace coverings must be worn except when on court.\nAll players must check in with the Service Victoria QR code displayed.\nThe club room and indoor facilities remain closed.\nBooking slots are at this stage for 50 minutes to allow a 10 minute change over time period. These will be on the hour to keep things manageable.\nPlayers must book in on the whiteboard at the courts for their 50 minute slot allowing for a 10 minute change over. Initially there will be four zones available for booking, Court 1, Court 2&3, Court 4&5 and Court 6.\n\nPlease do not attend the courts if you are not well.\nAt the present moment booking a court is restricted to members only, so please close the gate after you enter the site.\nBy utilising the facilities you are agreeing to follow these restrictions to ensure we are providing a COVID safe environment for all.\nMore information will come directly from Advantage Tennis re the start up of lessons and the coaching restrictions that will apply there.\nThank you for your understanding and we look forward to more easing of restrictions in the future.\nHPRTC Committee"

A close struggle for Saturday Rubbers 17, with 27 to 26 games but 2 sets to 4 down. So close!! Also Boys 9, a valiant struggle but couldn’t quite get there on the day. Well done and good luck for next season.\nWe have 15 teams entered for the Junior competition next season and due to the growing administration burden we will run a team meeting on Tuesday 23rd April from 6.30-7 pm for the purposes of meeting your team mates, collecting ball money ($20 for the whole season) , explaining procedures and etiquette and duty parent responsibilities. All participants are expected to attend or notify James Wotherspoon, our Junior Convenor if you are unable to attend, on 0407357318.\nWednesday evening Social is back on 10th and 17th April as adult competition pauses for the school holidays. Love to see you there. Courts open at 7.30 pm. $2 to cover light costs is appreciated. We know you love our courts but a reminder that it is not advisable to lend out your keys to non-members so that they can have a private social hit. Please invite your guests and friends to join you, or us, and advise them of the $5 visitor fee. Many thanks\nA big thank you to all of you who chip in to keep our facilities looking clean and tidy. A special mention to our Garden enthusiasts, Chris Hall, Viv White, Chris Wishart and Di Phillips, who’s never ending attention to the garden is truly appreciated by everyone. If you have any suggestions or requests for our tennis facilities, don’t hesitate to ring or email any of the committee members so that we can endeavour to supply what you need to enjoy your use of the club.\nSue Moreland,\nHappy Hitting!"

You can’t be in a team if you don’t join the club!! It’s essential for insurance purposes and is an association and club requirement. This side of things has taken up far too much time for myself and Chris, our lovely Club Membership Registrar. Your help is addressing this will hugely appreciated.\nAll players will need to be up to date with club membership BEFORE they are placed in a team- form AND payment. \nChris is extremely helpful and will support you with all you need to do to have this on track. If you’re not sure of your membership status, feel free to get in touch with her to check. (chriswish17@gmail.com , 0401 722 040) Please also note that membership runs on a financial year basis. All players will need to ensure that they keep their membership status current when we get to June/July. Chris is very happy to navigate this with you to cover Juniors seasons.\nMembership form is available from the club website. It’s a great deal really. Not many sports have membership that enables you to have such great access to club facilities at other times during every week of the year!"

    "text": "Greetings all members,\nHope you are all adapting to the wintery blast of May and June. It is astonishing how fast our tennis year has flown with most of the night tennis and mid-week competitions drawing to a close for this season. We are hopeful of some new flags to be added next week.\nOur Club Championships were run on June 1st and 2nd. Congratulations to all the finalists, with our standout Men’s Singles champion, Rod Beanland, and Women’s singles champion, Heather McMillan, taking home the trophies for 2019. The Boys Singles was won by Jamie Cranston and the Girls Singles won by Ella Beanland. A full list of results is included later in this newsletter. Thank you so much to Coach Ben and Luke for organising a great weekend.\nMany thanks to our local Sponsors, Cocoginger Hair Salon (Bayswater), and Tennis Victoria who donated prizes for our Champions this year.\nThere were many exciting, very entertaining matches both for the players and spectators who participated on the day. I challenge all who didn’t enter to step up and take part next year. It is a lot of fun and you get to see and play against people you may not usually encounter.\nNews for night players in KDNTA is that all finals will be played on the home courts of the team higher on the ladder from next season, including those clubs with synthetic grass, i.e. HE Parker tennis Club.\nOur AGM is coming up on the 20th July at 1pm. All are welcome to attend. Should you wish to take part on the committee we would love to hear from you. Unlike most volunteer organisations, we have a large group of willing committee members which makes running our club an easy, fun task.\nMany hands definitely do make light work and new ideas are always encouraged. I would like to personally thank all current committee members. You do an outstanding job. A reminder that all memberships come due on the 1st of July and renewals will be sent out with AGM invitations. We really appreciate the completed forms being returned as it makes matching them up with the payments so much easier on our much-loved membership secretary, Chris Wishart (who also manages keys, and tennis Balls, and night competition for you all).\nSocial tennis will be running on Wednesday evenings 7pm, beginning on the 19th of June during the break between season 1 and 2 for night competition. Season 2 will recommence week beginning 15 July.\nI wish you all the best for your next season, Happy Hitting, See you on court.\nSue Moreland"

    "text": "Greetings folks.\nHope this update finds you all well and coping with our changing world.\nAs you would be aware, the competition tennis which was due to resume last week did not start due to the resumed lockdown. I was pleased that tennis was more carefully considered in the guidelines due to the inherent nature of tennis giving us ample distance between players while on court playing a game. That said, our off-court behaviour between games needs to be mindful of the restrictions, so as to respect and protect each of our fellow players. I noted last week that our courts are being well utilised but the request for only singles to be played has inadvertently increased the number of people waiting for a turn (and worn us out faster). It appears if doubles were still allowed it would be easier to keep our social distance! Still, this is not the recommendation so we should try harder to comply, thereby keeping the courts open for us all to use. It is one of the few lucky sports to remain, so let’s make sure there is no reason for that to change.\nGreat news that Coach Ben is allowed to continue one-on-one coaching. Please support him and make use of the period we have been given to fine-tune your game. Plenty of scope for practice too.\nYour continued support of the club with many having paid their 2020/2021 memberships is very much appreciated. We realise the uncertainty is, well, uncertain.\nOur playing procedures now require each person to:\n\nBook a court through Ben Longridge;\nOrganise your own balls;\nBe mindful of your time period booked to free up for the next person\nUse the sanitiser;\nNO masks need be worn while playing is my understanding at this point;\nNo clubhouse access except to turn on court lights and toilet usage, and please clean thoroughly after use.\n\nWe have applied for a deferral of the AGM until November in the hope that gatherings will be allowed by then. If not, we will set up a Virtual AGM and send out the reports by email to each member. Many thanks again for your amazing understanding and for continuing to PLAY ON.\nHappy hitting! Sue Moreland"

As there is some asbestos present, special precautions are required and no-one needed to be scared by the space suits worn by removalists.\nSue Moreland, Happy Hitting!"

    "text": "Dear members\nAnother financial year is ending, and our AGM is fast approaching. It has been very rewarding to see that people have persisted with their tennis commitments through the many interruptions of our regular scheduled routines both competitions, coaching and social play. We have certainly become very flexible in adjusting our calendars at the drop of a hat!\nThe main purpose of this note is to request some commitment at renewal time to fill in the entire Membership form and sign the Code of Conduct form (which we sent out with the AGM notification), as we strive to update our records.\nAs it is important to us that your privacy is protected, these forms are kept in house for the HE Parker tennis Club records.\nWe have always taken pride in the fact that our club provides a friendly safe inclusive environment for the whole community. All our coaches and committee members are required to have a WWC check. It would be appreciated if you could indicate if you have a WWC check too.\nMy final request is to ask you to consider stepping into a role on the committee this year. I have spent more than 15 years on the committee in variousroles and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them. It is a great group of people to work and play with and we need YOU to join us to continue to grow. Every pair of hands ensures that the load is shared\nPlease note that during school holidays there is social tennis on Wednesday nights, play starts at 7pm sharp ! See you there.\nWarmest wishes & Happy hitting!\nSue Moreland"

    "text": "Frank and Betty Secomb were the first Life Members of our great club. While Betty died some years ago, Frank celebrated his 102nd birthday on 20 August 2020.\nDuring the mid to late 1970s, we did not have enough courts for all juniors to play Saturday morning competition, so courts in the area needed to be hired. Frank and Betty had a court at the rear of their home on the corner of Heathmont Road and Bennett Ave – you have probably passed it many times without realising it. They kindly made their court available to the club for competition.\nFor those who remember Frank, he was always impeccably dressed and was a “complete gentleman”."

    "text": "Greetings,\nWelcome to 2018!\nIt promises to be a busy Year for HE Parker tennis club with the long-awaited bathroom renovations beginning on March the 5th. There have been a few negotiations with council which have seen the addition of the pergola at the entrance to the clubhouse being built at the same time by the same builder. This will mean a reduction in construction time but an increase in inconvenience during the works which are expected to take 3½ - 4 months.\nThe first important date to note will be Tuesday 6th where ALL access to the clubhouse will be blocked during the day as Asbestos cladding inside the bathrooms will be being removed. After this our access to the courts and club house will be limited to access through the gate on court 2 and 3, then through to courts 4 & 5 and then in through the double doors facing courts 4&5. (Remember to let your visiting teams know in advance or meet them and escort them onto the premises.) Temporary walls will be erected inside the club rooms allowing work to begin on East facing wall and the area where the new door into the bathroom area is to be constructed. So, we will have a smaller kitchen area and the fridge will be relocated. Access to the light box, alarm cupboard in the club will be maintained as usual.\nThere will be a portable toilet block (2) on site near the carpark which will be plumbed in (YEAY) for use the whole time. Access for coaching and the Shed will be through the gate between court 5 and 6.\nRemember when entering the facility to be mindful and considerate of games in play and also to keep out of the way of the builders. They will have a much more difficult work site than they are used to because we need to continue our use of the Facility. Please make it as easy and SAFE as possible for them to do their job and remember to Prohibit any children from entering the work site.\nThanks to everyone for being patient and flexible. It should be well worth the Wait.\nOur Club’s Head Coach, Ben, has been travelling around and competing on the ITF Seniors Circuit since June last year. He has won 2 titles in the Over 35’s Doubles category and come runners up in the other 3 tournaments he’s entered. Latest ITF Rankings see him ranked a career-high #10 for Doubles and #92 for Singles, worldwide. Ben considers himself a bit of a “doubles specialist” and his aim is to be selected to represent Australia in the upcoming World Team Championships in Miami, Florida. He has the Oceania Regional Championships to play at Kooyong next month and we wish him all the best in his endeavours. You can track his progress at www.itftennis.com.\nBen sent 28 Hot Shots kids to the Australian Open in January. Again, it was a great experience and all reports from coaches and parents was positive.\nSue Moreland, Happy Hitting!"
